<h1>FCC Projects: 'API Development'</h1>
<p>This is the github repo for all of my API Development on FCC</p>
<p>This app is built with NodeJs and will contain seperate endpoints for each project. This application is built with a "component" style architecture, to ensure that all files pertaining to a single FCC project are stored in one location. There is also a "shared" directory, for views and services that are to be shared between components. This project is hosted on Heroku at the following location: https://fathomless-castle-93664.herokuapp.com/</p>
